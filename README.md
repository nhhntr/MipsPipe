MipsPipe
========
This is intended for EE 4243 Computer Organization and Architecture.
That being said, this is going to be for a pipelined mips processor. This project may not be the best and is strongly based off of the book that was required for this course. In my free time however, I may update this for fun and practice.

The software suite used for this will be xilinx.
