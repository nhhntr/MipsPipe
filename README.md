MipsPipe
========
This is intended for EE 4243 Computer Organization and Architecture.
That being said, this is going to be for a pipelined mips processor. This project may not be the best and is strongly based off of the book that was required for this course. In my free time however, I may update this for fun and practice.

The software suite used for this will be xilinx.   


Note: Some of this code will be heavily borrowed from the book that this course was based around. No copy right intended, also as this project progresses it will get farther away from said book and also should hopefully add extra functionality.
